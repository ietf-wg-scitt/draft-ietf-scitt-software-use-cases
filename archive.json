While \"air-gapped\" is a common term, it's often used to refer to highly isolated environments. While users are embracing cloud environments, they still wish to maintain network isolation, through virtual private networks. Can/should we reword this section to refer to the more common network isolated environments? The subtle difference between network-isolated and air-gapped is a network-isolated environment may enable ingress/egress rules while an air-gapped environment may implement a data-diode that allows content to go into an environment but the environment can never reach out. (diode = one-way)\r\n",
